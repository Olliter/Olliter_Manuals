## Setting the device address using OL-Master

After executing the software, an error message will appear, informing the user that the connection to the device is not available, click OK to proceed.

If the dialog does not appear, it means that OL-Master was able to discover the device on the local network using UDP broadcast, this does not impact the procedure.
