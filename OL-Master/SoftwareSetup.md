> During the update process, if any previous bandplan configuration files are detected, the installer will ask if you want to keep them or to replace them with the new default ones. If you have customized bandplans, it is recommended to keep the existing files.

Once the setup is completed, users can choose to start the software immediately or to close the installer. The software can be started later from the start menu or from the desktop shortcut if created.
